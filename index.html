                <h1>I'm Mirko van der Waal.</h1>
                <h3>Experienced Linux user and Software engineer.</h3>
                <p>I like to make things. I spent most of my time either learning
                something new or getting better at what I already know.
                I would consider myself most familiar with Shell, Javascript
                including (NodeJS) and
                Python but have been experimenting in Rust and CommonLisp recently.
                Apart from programming languages alone I am also familiar with
                different database (structures) under SQL and Redis.
                I have experience maintaining and using a Linux system through
                the terminal and am most comfortable here. </p>

                    <h3>Coffeescript, Javascript, Redis</h3>
                    <p>Octagon is a small and efficient backend for creating
                    ticketing systems. It it written mostly in Coffeescript with
                    hints of Javascript and the data is effectively stored in
                    Redis. All of the methods are created with Promises in mind
                    making them easy to integrate in your existing code. I chose
                    to use Coffeescript and Redis here for both efficiency, practice and
                    readability.</p>

                    <h3>Javascript, CSS, PHP</h3>
                    <p>Teachery is a web application tool designed to help
                    teachers out with common taks under which sorting and
                    performing asynchronous countdowns. It works on both mobile
                    and web and has unofficial inegration with Magister, which
                    is a popular school management system in there Netherlands.
                    We decided to create web application with these techniques
                    to create as support as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Python, API</h3>
                    <p>A small bot I started working on with 2 other
                    students. It is mainly designed to show us pictures of cats
                    but can also search on the populair search engine
                    <a href="https://ddg.gg" target="_blank">duckduckgo</a>,
                    use their convenient
                    <a href="https://ddg.gg/bang" target="_blank">bang</a>s,
                    Scrape subreddits for relevant
                    images and has a small admin system implemented which can disable
                    commands and have the bot ignore users. We went with Python
                    for familiarity in this scenario.

                    <p>Moe is an tool created to upload files quickly. It was
                    originally created to upload screenshots quickly to a single
                    site, but that time has past (un)fortunately. It now uploads
                    to any site that relies on
                    <a href="https://github.com/nokonoko/Pomf" target="_blank">pomf.se</a>
                    source code. I used bash for native usage of the cURL functionality.
