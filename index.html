            Captain is a wrapper application for lemonbar (customizable bar
            based on xcb). It makes the annoying things such as: Seperate scripts,
            layout, mouse events and color a lot easier by using a single
            configuration file and a logical directory hierarchy.

            Think of it like <a href="https://passwordstore.org">pass</a>, except
            with more features and a more maintainable codebase. orml is a
            password/data manager which offers various security and convenience
            features.
